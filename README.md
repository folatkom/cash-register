## General info
This project contains a function simulating a cash register drawer, taking as arguments: price to pay, cash payed and actual state of a drawer, divided into values of: 0.01$, 0.05$, 0.1$, 0.25$, 1$, 5$, 10$, 20$ and 100$.
The function returns change divided into proper coin values or an adequate message if funds in the drawer are insufficient.

## Technologies
Project is created with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.

## Inspiration
This project is inspired by task on freecodecamp.org (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/cash-register),
being also one of the projects I finished to earn JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certificate. 
The whole solution (meaning the whole code) is my own work.
